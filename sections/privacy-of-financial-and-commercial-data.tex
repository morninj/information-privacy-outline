\subsubsection{Fair Credit Reporting Act}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1970: FCRA.
    \item Scope turns on the definition of ``consumer report.'' Most reports 
    dealing with consumer credit fall within this definition.\footnote{Casebook 
    p. 758.}
    \item Statutory requirements: see casebook pp. 758--65.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{\emph{Smith v. Bob Smith Chevrolet, Inc.}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Smith agreed to buy a car from Bob Smith. Part of the deal involved a 
    trade-in of his existing car, for which Bob Smith would assume the remainder 
    of unpaid loans. He also got a GM employee discount.\footnote{Casebook p. 
    765--77..}
    \item After the sale, Bob Smith learned that it had mistakenly doubled 
    Smith's discount. It accessed Smith's consumer report. Smith argued that Bob 
    Smith negligently and wilfully violated FCRA.\footnote{Casebook p. 766.}
    \item First, Bob Smith argued that it accessed the report as part of a 
    ``business transaction.'' The court held that Congress intended to allow 
    access to reports in this context for the purpose of determining the 
    customer's eligibility for a benefit. But in this case, the use was not in 
    connection with a standard business transaction. It was not for a reason 
    beneficial to the consumer. Smith, the buyer, did not initiate the 
    transaction under which Bob Smith accessed his consumer 
    report.\footnote{Casebook p. 767-68.}
    \item Second, Bob Smith argued that it accessed the report in connection 
    with ``collection of an account of the consumer.'' But a debt did not 
    actually exist here. Bob Smith \emph{alleged} a debt but did not prove its 
    existence.\footnote{Casebook p. 768--69..}
    \item Whether Bob Smith's noncompliance was wilful was a jury 
    question.\footnote{Casebook p. 769.}
\end{enumerate}
