\subsection{The Financial Services Industry and Personal Data}

\subsubsection{Fair Credit Reporting Act}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1970: FCRA.
    \item Scope turns on the definition of ``consumer report.'' Most reports 
    dealing with consumer credit fall within this definition.\footnote{Casebook 
    p. 758.}
    \item Statutory requirements: see casebook pp. 758--65.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{\emph{Smith v. Bob Smith Chevrolet, Inc.}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Smith agreed to buy a car from Bob Smith. Part of the deal involved a 
    trade-in of his existing car, for which Bob Smith would assume the remainder 
    of unpaid loans. He also got a GM employee discount.\footnote{Casebook p. 
    765--77..}
    \item After the sale, Bob Smith learned that it had mistakenly doubled 
    Smith's discount. It accessed Smith's consumer report. Smith argued that Bob 
    Smith negligently and wilfully violated FCRA.\footnote{Casebook p. 766.}
    \item First, Bob Smith argued that it accessed the report as part of a 
    ``business transaction.'' The court held that Congress intended to allow 
    access to reports in this context for the purpose of determining the 
    customer's eligibility for a benefit. But in this case, the use was not in 
    connection with a standard business transaction. It was not for a reason 
    beneficial to the consumer. Smith, the buyer, did not initiate the 
    transaction under which Bob Smith accessed his consumer 
    report.\footnote{Casebook p. 767-68.}
    \item Second, Bob Smith argued that it accessed the report in connection 
    with ``collection of an account of the consumer.'' But a debt did not 
    actually exist here. Bob Smith \emph{alleged} a debt but did not prove its 
    existence.\footnote{Casebook p. 768--69..}
    \item Whether Bob Smith's noncompliance was wilful was a jury 
    question.\footnote{Casebook p. 769.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Identity Theft}

\paragraph{Identity Theft Statutes}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identity Theft Assumption and Deterrence Act: federal, 
    1998.\footnote{Casebook p. 786.}
    \item FCRA/FACTA---see below.
    \item More than 40 state laws.
    \item Solove: the credit system enables identity theft, e.g., by the 
    frequent use of SSNs as identifiers.\footnote{Casebook p. 787--88..}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Tort Law: \emph{Wolfe v. MBNA America Bank}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Wolfe sued MBNA after his identity was stolen. MBNA moved to dismiss.
    \item MBNA had issued a credit card in Wolfe's name to the thief. Wolfe 
    argued that MBNA had a duty to identify ``the accuracy and authenticity'' of 
    the credit application.\footnote{Casebook p. 789.}
    \item MBNA relied on a South Carolina decision holding that banks are not 
    negligent if they issue credit cards on the basis of fraudulent 
    applications.\footnote{Casebook p. 790.}
    \item The court here held that the South Carolina decision was flawed 
    because it was foreseeable that injury would result from negligent issuance 
    of a credit card. Banks must take reasonable measures to prevent identity 
    theft.\footnote{Casebook p. 791.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Commercial Entities and Personal Data}

\subsubsection{Governance by Tort}

\paragraph{Intrusion upon Seclusion and Appropriation: \emph{Dwyer v. American 
Express Co.}}
~\\\\
Selling cardholder data is not actionable as intrusion upon seclusion or 
appropriation.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a class action, American Express cardholders sued over the 
    company's practice of selling cardholder data.\footnote{Casebook p. 799.}
    \item Intrusion upon seclusion:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Elements:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Unauthorized intrustion.
            \item Offensive or objectionable.
            \item Private matter.
            \item Anguish and suffering.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Held: plaintiffs failed to satisfy the first element because they 
        voluntarily disclosed the information to AMEX. Names and addresses are 
        disclosed (for lists of consumers with specific spending habits), but no 
        financial information is disclosed.\footnote{Casebook p. 800.}
        \item Appropriation:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Elements: appropriation of name or likeness without without 
            consent for another's benefit.
            \item Held: individual cardholder names do not create value for the 
            defendants; moreover, disclosure or sale does not deprive 
            cardholders of any value.\footnote{Casebook p. 801.}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
